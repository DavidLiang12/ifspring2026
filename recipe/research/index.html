<h1>Recipe Page - Research (Beef Wellington)</h1>

<p>
Beef Wellington is a classic dish made by wrapping a beef tenderloin in mushroom duxelles,
prosciutto, and puff pastry, then baking it until golden. The goal is to keep the beef tender
and medium-rare while achieving crisp pastry.

This page is clean and direct, with ingredients and instructions clearly separated. Ingredients listed on the left, steps on the right.
There are no distracting ads, and the layout makes it easy to follow each step with the bolded numbers.

The recipe begins with a helpful video and quick overview of difficulty, time, and serving size.
The downside is that the ingredient list appears after the instructions, which is not user friendly since people usually start by reading the ingredients.

This site has a strong layout with a video and summary information at the top.
However, the amount of ads interrupt the reading and reduces clarity.

The TFT website is a great example and can be implemented in a recipe website. It has general info on the top followed by early and mid game plan, each has its unique section.
 What I want to get out of this website is how they managed to section different kinds of information and placed them effectively on the screen.

This site is a great example of good image placement with text. Large images are used as visual anchors, and sections often place text near or on top of imagery.
The overlaps and spacing make the page feel premium and dynamic while still being readable and not crowded.

Apple’s product page is a clear example of strong visual communication. Each section focuses on one message at a time with large imagery and short text.
I want to borrow this one idea per section structure to make recipe steps feel less overwhelming and easier for users to to follow.
