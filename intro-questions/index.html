    <li>
      <strong>Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</strong><br>
      I'm very interested in interactive media espically in game design. This class is perfect to learn the fundamentals
        of site design which I think could be very useful in my future career.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</strong><br>
      I have experiences with HTML, CSS as well as JavaScript. I have created many websites for both personal and school projects.
      Taking the rapid prototype and web development classes in previous years.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</strong><br>
      I hope to learn how to design cleaner and more effective, and start working on my personal website.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</strong><br>
      Designing for screens is interactive and dynamic while paper is just still, user cannot move or interact with anthing on it.
      Screen design have to take in account for screen size, movement, and also clicking to other pages.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</strong><br>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">Youtube</a><br>
      I think YouTube's design is very efftive in balancing a complex functionality with clean visual hierarchy,
      it makes it easy to navigate through all the content while maintaining a familiar interface.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</strong><br>
      <a href="https://www.porsche.com" target="_blank">Porsche</a><br>
      Porsche's website effectively communicates to the users of luxury and performance through the model design and layout,
      clear product information, and an intuitive structure that guides users through their vehicle lineup.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</strong><br>
      <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/" target="_blank">Apple Vision Pro Site</a><br>
      The Vision Pro site works really well with immersive scrolling animations and 3D visuals, while maintaining clarity and easy to navigate.
      I really liked the section where the show the internal components of the device with interactive 3D model, and combines it into the full product as
        you scroll down the page.
